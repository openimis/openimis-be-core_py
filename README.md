## Generic features

### Calendars
This module provides a configurable calendar 'mount' abstracting all calendar aspects(fields, dates and calculations,...) from the other modules.
Using the core.calendar and core.datetime, you enable your module to non-Gregorian calendars.
Today, openIMIS supports Gregorian and Nepali calendars.
The mounted calendar and datetime provide helpers method to perform date calculations according to the configured calendar (add months, years,....)

Ensure you profit from this feature by importing calendar and datetime from core instead of the python standard ones:
```
from core import calendar, datetime
```
Your models should also use the provided custom fields:
```
from core.fields import DateField, DateTimeField
```

### UserManager
openIMIS backend is configured for SSO, receiving the user (login) in the REMOTE_USER http header. Since django security is defined uppon User (core_User table), the UserManager auto-provision the received login (REMOTE_USER) as User, binding it (i_user) to the corresponding InteractiveUser record.
The auto-provisioning assigns a default Group (name can be parameterized) from which django permissions are calculated (with UserRole - Role - RoleRight contributed from InteractiveUser).
Note: if not existing, the default group is created at startup.

### Mutations & Signals
The OpenIMISMutation class of this module provides the template code for
all openIMIS mutations. Based on "async_mutations" it detaches (or not)
the processing to a workers process (via queuing). It also automatically
triggers 4 signals per mutation: one at a global level (should you want
to listen to all mutations, regardless of module) and 3 at module level:
* **signal_mutation_module_validate**: this is called when validating the
  requested mutation. Returning errors here will reject the mutation
  (see below)
* **signal_mutation_module_before_mutating**: sent after the validation and
  before performing the actual mutation
* **signal_mutation_module_after_mutating**: sent when the mutation has
  finished

To register a module on a (mutation) signal, one can register a callback
via bind_signals() in his module's schema.py file.

```
from core.schema import signal_mutation_module_validate, signal_mutation_module_before_mutating, signal_mutation_module_after_mutating


def on_claim_mutation(sender, **kwargs):
    errors = []
    # errors.extend(trigger_my_extension(kwargs))
    return errors


def bind_signals():
    signal_mutation_module_validate["claim"].connect(on_claim_mutation)
```

If the callback raises an exception, the mutation is marked as failed,
with a generic error message.

If the callback returns an array of error message:
```
[{'message': 'message to the user', 'code': 'optional error code', 'detail': 'optional error detail'}]
```
If the callback returns None (or an empty array), the mutation is marked as successful.

__Important Note__: by default the callback is executed __in transaction__ and, as a consequence, will (in case of exception/errors) cancel the complete mutation. If this is not the desired behaviour, the callback must explicitely detach to separate transaction (process).

#### Extending mutations with signals
Signal callbacks could use mutationExtensions JSON field to receive additional data from mutation payload. This
feature allows to extend mutations with a new module without modifying the base mutation.

#### Service signals 
In addition, the core provides the possibility to register additional signals via 
the `register_service_signal` decorator. Registered signals are stored in
the `core.signals.REGISTERED_SERVICE_SIGNALS` dictionary. Signal name has to be unique.  
**Example use:**
```python
@register_service_signal('create_policy', PolicyServiceClass)
def create_policy(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...
```
Will create new RegisteredServiceSignal instance available from  
`REGISTERED_SERVICE_SIGNALS['create_policy'].`

When running the application, the modules are searched for the `bind_service_signals()` 
function in the module_name/signals.py directory. This method should use `core.signals.bind_service_signal`
function to connect new signals. Receivers can be registered also in other places.

#### Modules Scheduled Tasks
To add a scheduled task directly from within a module, add the file `scheduled_tasks.py` 
in the module package. From there, the function `schedule_tasks` accepting `BackgroundScheudler` 
as argument must be accessible. 

**Example content of scheduled_tasks.py:**
```python
def module_task():
    ...

def schedule_tasks(scheduler: BackgroundScheduler): # Has to accept BackgroundScheudler as input
    scheduler.add_job(
        module_task,
        trigger=CronTrigger(hour=8),  # Daily at 8 AM
        id="custom_schedule_id",  # Must be unique across application
        max_instances=1
    )    
```
Task will be automatically registered, but it will not be triggered unless `SCHEDULER_AUTOSTART` setting is
set to `True`.

### Graphene Custom Types & Helper Classes/Methods
* schema.SmallInt: Integer, with values ranging from -32768 to +32767
* schema.TinyInt: Integer (8 bit), with values ranging from 0 to 255
* utils.filter_validity: many openIMIS entities have a validity_from/validity_to, this filters provides a helper implementing the vality logic based on date (today if None)
Sample usage:
```
Insuree.objects.get(
        Q(chf_id=kwargs.get('chfId')),
        *filter_validity(**kwargs)
    )
```
* utils.prefix_filterset: helper method to provide dynamic filtering on related (FK) entities
Sample usage:
```
class ClaimGQLType(DjangoObjectType):
    """
    Main element for a Claim. It can contain items and/or services.
    The filters are possible on BatchRun, Insuree, HealthFacility, Admin and ICD in addition to the Claim fields
    themselves.
    """

    class Meta:
        model = Claim
        exclude_fields = ('row_id',)
        interfaces = (graphene.relay.Node,)
        filter_fields = {
            "uuid": ["exact"],
            "code": ["exact", "istartswith", "icontains", "iexact"],
            "status": ["exact"],
            "date_claimed": ["exact", "lt", "lte", "gt", "gte"],
            "date_from": ["exact", "lt", "lte", "gt", "gte"],
            "date_to": ["exact", "lt", "lte", "gt", "gte"],
            "feedback_status": ["exact"],
            "review_status": ["exact"],
            "claimed": ["exact", "lt", "lte", "gt", "gte"],
            "approved": ["exact", "lt", "lte", "gt", "gte"],
            "visit_type": ["exact"],
            **prefix_filterset("icd__", DiagnosisGQLType._meta.filter_fields),
            **prefix_filterset("admin__", ClaimAdminGQLType._meta.filter_fields),
            **prefix_filterset("health_facility__", HealthFacilityGQLType._meta.filter_fields),
            **prefix_filterset("insuree__", InsureeGQLType._meta.filter_fields),
            **prefix_filterset("batch_run__", BatchRunGQLType._meta.filter_fields)
        }
        connection_class = ExtendedConnection
```
* schema.OrderedDjangoFilterConnectionField: extension of the `graphene_django.filter.DjangoFilterConnectionField` class, providing a generic implementation of the `orderBy` GraphQL query parameter
Sample usage:
```
class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    claims = OrderedDjangoFilterConnectionField(
        ClaimGQLType, orderBy=graphene.List(of_type=graphene.String))
```
* ExtendedConnection: extension of the `graphene.Connection` class, implementing the `totalCount` and `edgesCount` GraphQL Pagination values.

#### GQL Decorators
* @mutation_on_uuids_from_filter: additional decorator for async_mutate allowing executing mutations by filters instead
of list of uuids. Example usage (claim submit mutation from claim module):
```python
__filter_handlers = {
        'services': 'services__service__code__in',
        'items': 'items__item__code__in'
    }
...
@classmethod
@mutation_on_uuids_from_filter(Claim, ClaimGQLType, 'additional_filters', __filter_handlers)
def async_mutate(cls, user, **data):
    ...
```
### Django Admin
It also provides the admin console forms (UI), including the
TechnicalUserForm (ability to add technical users from the console)

### Django Lookup
* jsoncontains - the module introduces an additional `jsoncontains` filtering parameter to the django query, 
  which allows filtering by json field attributes in the SQL Server database. Filtering by simple data types and nested 
  arguments. The use is as follows:
  ```
  claim.objects.filter(json_ext__jsoncontains={'amount': 10.00, 'adress': { 'country': 'X', 'city': 'Y'}})
  ```
* jsoncontainskey - another custom filtering parameter for json fields. Equivalent to `__contains` search on
  underlying serialized json string. It allows queries as:
  ```
  claim.objects.filter(json_ext__jsoncontainskey='amount')
  ```
  This query searches for `"amouunt":` in json string, so it will match keys in nested json objects
  
### WebSocket client
The module gives access to WebSocket clients allowing external socket communication. 
Two types of clients are available: 
* `BaseWebSocketClient` - for sending synchronous requests.
* `AsyncWebSocketClient` - for asynchronous communication.

Content of `send` can be string or bytes.
The `add_action_on_receive(callable)` method allows defining custom action to be performed 
when message is received from the server. If no action is set the client returns received messages in `receive()` method. 
Client require opening connection before sending and receiving messages. 
It is also possible to open connection temporally in with context:

```
socket = BaseWebSocketClient('ws://socket_url')
with websocket_instance.connect() as connection: # keeps connection open
  socket_instance.send("message") # sends message
```

    
## Additional endpoints
* core/users/current_user: provides information on the logged (in
  session) user: login, rights, attached health facility,...
  
## Abstract calculation rule class
* core/abs_calculation_rule: here is defined the abstract calculation rule class that might be used
    for defining some calculation rules.
* class is a representation of calculation rule. Here are defined some informations about rule and how some actions 
    are implemented. 
* members
  - version (static) - the version is used to keep track of the changes in the version of the calculation rule,
  - status - integer, {inactive, future, active, archived}
  - uuid (static) -  to follow the version of the calculation
  - calculation_rule_name (static) - short name of the calculation rule
  - description (static) - text about the calculation rule how works, for what purpose is defined etc
  - list of impacted class and parameters - the representation of available parameters and their values/properties for chosen model. Example:
 ```
CLASS_RULE_PARAM_VALIDATION = [
    {
        "class": "ContributionPlan",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "type": "select",
                "name": "rate",
                "label": {
                    "en": "Percentage of income",
                    "fr": "Pourcentage du salaire"
                },
                "rights": {
                    "read": "151201",
                    "write": "151202",
                    "update": "151203",
                    "replace": "151206",
                },
                'optionSet': [
                    {
                        "value": "5",
                        "label": {
                            "en": "5%",
                            "fr": "5%"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "value": "10",
                        "label": {
                            "en": "10%",
                            "fr": "10%"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "value": "15",
                        "label": {
                            "en": "15%",
                            "fr": "15%"
                        }
                    },
                ],
                "default": "5"
            },
   },
]
```
* abstract methods defined on rule level
  - ready() - method to register signals so as to wait for actions. This method makes sure the calculation is registered - status "active" 
    (if not the line should be added with "inactive status") and register the signals only if it is active
    all rules, if active will have to register to the signal sent by "getRuleDetails"
  - check_calculation(instance) - this function will get the calculation relative the instance
  - active_for_object(object, context) - this method will contains the checks if the calculation need to be executed for the object on that context. 
      The default context will be:
      - create
      - update 
      - delete
      - submit
      - amend
      - replace
      - check
      - validate
     
    This function is required because the same class can have different calculation based on the object members values (like product etc)
 
  - calculate(instance, *args) - Function that will do the calculation based on the parameters
  - get_linked_class(List[classname]) - that function will return the possible instance that can have a link to the calculation
  - convert(instance, convert_to, **argv) - Convert on or several object toward another type, especially to invoice or bill . It will check the from-to, and the rights then will call the Function Name with agrv as parameters
* generic methods defined on abstract class level
  - get_rule_name(classname) - return an object which is representation of calculaton rule
  - get_rule_details(classname) - return the data about class and parameters
  - get_parameters(class_name, instance) - Function to obtain the required parameter and its properties for an instance of certain model. 
      This function is registered to the module signal via the ready function if the rule is active
  - run_calculation_rules(instance, context) - trigger the calculations. This function is registered to the module signal via the ready function if the rule is active
  - run_convert(instance, convert_to **argv) - execute the conversion for the instance with the first rule that provide the conversion (see get_convert_from_to). 'from_to' is deducted from instance. 
  - get_convert_from_to() - get the possible conversion, return [calc UUID, from, to]

## CustomFilters
This module provides the ability to define custom filters and their construction. It includes the following classes:
* ```CustomFilterRegistryPoint```: This class is responsible for registering filters from a specific module. 
* ```CustomFilterWizardInterface```: This interface defines the implementation details of a custom filtering wizard.
It should be called in the apps.py file of the respective module (see example below) to enable filter construction for specific objects.
* ```CustomFilterWizardStorage```: This class provides a service that connects to the registered filter hub, allowing 
retrieval of the filter construction definition for specific objects.

To integrate this mechanism into an openIMIS module, follow these steps:
* Implement the CustomFilterWizardInterface from the core module
to output the filter construction definition for the chosen object.
* In the apps.py file of the module, add the following import statement: ```from core.custom_filters import CustomFilterRegistryPoint```.
* Invoke such example code somewhere in ready() method in apps.py file:
```
   # register custom filter
   from social_protection.custom_filters import BenefitPlanCustomFilterWizard, BeneficiaryCustomFilterWizard
   CustomFilterRegistryPoint.register_custom_filters(
       module_name=cls.name,
       custom_filter_class_list=[BenefitPlanCustomFilterWizard, BeneficiaryCustomFilterWizard]
   )
``` 
* After completing the above steps, the filter will be registered in the filter hub/storage and can be accessed 
by invoking the wizard hub service. Here's an example using the Django shell:
```
   from core.custom_filters.custom_filter_wizard_storage import CustomFilterWizardStorage
   CustomFilterWizardStorage.build_output_how_to_build_filter('social_protection', 'Beneficiary')
```
